# Introduction
Human nature, when travelling for any goal/purpose is to measure, is to take the shortest route possible. In terms of economics, amenities are situated within a general radius of one another that accommodate a person's frequency of travel to said locations. Pharmacies are often frequented by the general population and therefore do not require a large amount of people to sustain them. Hence, these places are often small but several throughout a region. In our study, we measure the difference in distance travelled (as a  collective) increases when there are less pharmacies in a given area. 

# Methodology
Blah blah blah g

$$
\text{max} \sum_{i \in I} g_iY_i \\
\text{s.t.} \sum_{j \in N_i}x_j \geq Y_i \ \forall i \in I, \ (1)\\
\sum_{j \in J} x_j \leq p, \ (2) \\
x_j, Y_i \in \{0,1\}, \\
Y_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i \text{ is covered by at least one facility} \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise }\end{cases}.

# Case Study | Mecklenburg  County, North Carolina

In Mecklenburg County we counted pharmacies out the ass.

key points
removed demand notes with population demand of 0 because application limit of 10k row per location  allocation command. 

```{r Chart 1}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/TrevorKap/Classes_MUSA/raw/604516eac37357921ca422d10afb507ff430280a/SpatialOptimization/PharmacyMilesHW3.png")

```

15 and 35 highlighted to show the huge ass difference there is. 
Measuring total weighted distance as in the cumulative amount of miles travelled by all people of a population to reach each pharmacy. 

```{r Map 1}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/TrevorKap/Classes_MUSA/raw/604516eac37357921ca422d10afb507ff430280a/SpatialOptimization/Map35.png")

```


Pharmacies of p= 35 include the pharmacies of p=15 but not vise versa.  

```{r Map 2 All}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/TrevorKap/Classes_MUSA/raw/604516eac37357921ca422d10afb507ff430280a/SpatialOptimization/MapAllhw3.png")

```

Here is the one of everyone, nothing too much different but 35 lowkey seems pretty reasonable. 


# Conclusion
